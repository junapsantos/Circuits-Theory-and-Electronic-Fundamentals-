In this laboratory assignment the objective of analysing a simple circuit has been
achieved. 
Static analysis has been performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. 
The results obtained by octave in both the nodal and mesh theoretical analysis matched each other. 
The simulation results matched the theoretical results precisely.
The reason for this perfect match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
and simulation models cannot differ.
